# Coordinated Movement System For AI


Coordinated movement systems are a powerful tool for achieving a variety of tasks and goals. By enabling multiple autonomous agents or robots to move in a coordinated manner, these systems can be used to achieve objectives that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish using individual robots.
 

## Goal and Result

The goal of this project is to create a coordinated movement system using AI. The system will be designed to control a group of agents, in this case we will be calling them soldiers, in a coordinated manner with the aim of achieving a common task or goal. The system will be based on the AI class and will be able to move the robots accordingly depending on the given situation, this way the system can adapt and improve over time. The end goal of the project is to have a robust and efficient coordinated movement system that can be applied to a RTS type game.

### Current Different Classes

The classes currently have no real difference except for color.

- King: The king will always be the center of the formations. It will always be surrounded or leading the soldiers. There can only be one king at the moment. 
- Rangers: Their position will always be at the back or middle.
- Sword: The typical knight, these will position between the rangers ans shields.
- Shields: Meant to be defense type soldiers, these will always be at the front or the furthest away from the center.


## Circle Formation

One example of this, is the formation of a circle using polar coordinates. Polar coordinates are a way of specifying the position of a point in two-dimensional space. Rather than using Cartesian coordinates (x and y), polar coordinates specify the position of a point based on its distance from a central point (r) and the angle between that point and a reference direction (Î¸). This makes polar coordinates particularly well suited for circle formation, as they allow for easy adjustment of the circle's size and shape.
